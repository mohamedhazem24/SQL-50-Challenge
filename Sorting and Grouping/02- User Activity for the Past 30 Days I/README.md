# 02- User Activity for the Past 30 Days I


---

**Problem Statement**

Table: Activity

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |

This table may have duplicate rows. The `activity_type` column is an ENUM (category) of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message'). The table shows the user activities for a social media website. Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.

Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on a given day if they made at least one activity on that day.

Return the result table in any order.

**Example**

Input:
```
Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
```

Output:
```
+------------+--------------+ 
| day        | active_users |
+------------+--------------+ 
| 2019-07-20 | 2            |
| 2019-07-21 | 2            |
+------------+--------------+ 
```

**Explanation**

Note that we do not care about days with zero active users.

**Solution**

```sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(activity_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM Activity 
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN TO_DATE('2019-06-28', 'YYYY-MM-DD') AND TO_DATE('2019-07-27', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
GROUP BY activity_date
ORDER BY day;
```
